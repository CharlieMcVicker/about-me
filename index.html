          About me
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am a young software developer living in Southern VT. I just finished
          my freshman year at Union College, in Scenectady, where I study math,
          computer science, philosophy and German. My personal interests are in
          theory of mind, translation, continental philosphy, metaphysics,
          ontology, and the applications of math and computer science, as well
          as the benefits of living at the intersection of the two, within these
          topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school, I like to study ontotheology and theology in
          general, especially in regards recovering a meaninful relationship
          with place in nonagricultural communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond that, I like to play the guitar, study bio-dynamic farming, and
          stand with a sign in my local roundabout.

              <p>
                I started this project this spring with a friend from school. We
                drew inspiration from a number of other modern sites, with the
                goal of creating a clean but inviting experienced centered on
                communicating the message of the organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                I personally oversaw the project and made the landing page, a
                'Meet the Team' view, and a sample content page. I was lucky
                enough to hand off developement to my friend Ian who is now
                managing the project.
              </p>
              <p>
                All that's to say is this project is currently under development
                and I am no longer on the team, so I'm not sure what the site
                uptime is like.
